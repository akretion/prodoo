For background, see [npm#10074](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10074).\n\nDetect if we were run as a result of `npm publish`. This is intended to allow you to\neasily have prepublish lifecycle scripts that don't run when you run `npm install`.\n\n```\n$ npm install --save-dev in-publish\nin-publish@1.0.0 node_modules/in-publish\n```\n\nThen edit your package.json to have:\n\n```json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"prepublish\": \"in-publish && thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install || not-in-publish\"\n  }\n```\n\nNow when you run:\n\n```\n$ npm install\n```\nThen `thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` won't be run, but...\n\n```\n$ npm publish\n```\nAnd `thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` will be run.\n\nIt's worth noting that the `prepublish` lifecycle is _ALSO_ called when you build a tarball, so:\n\n```\n$ npm pack\n```\n\nWill call your `prepublish` lifecycle, but with the example above,\n`thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` won't be run.\n\nIf you want this, you can use another helper included here:\n\n```json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"prepublish\": \"not-in-install && thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install || in-install\"\n  }\n```\n\nThe above will run your `thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` on `publish` and\non `pack` but not on `install`.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"iarna","email":"me@re-becca.org"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-06-19T00:58:30.931Z","created":"2015-01-13T03:26:01.320Z","1.0.0":"2015-01-13T03:26:01.320Z","1.1.0":"2015-01-13T04:25:48.596Z","1.1.1":"2015-01-13T05:06:26.928Z","2.0.0":"2015-07-07T19:01:29.155Z","2.0.1":"2020-03-16T19:50:05.783Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/iarna/in-publish","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/iarna/in-publish.git"},"author":{"name":"Rebecca Turner","email":"me@re-becca.org"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/iarna/in-publish/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"joeybaker":true,"julien-f":true,"brentonhouse":true,"abhisekp":true,"backnight":true,"iarna":true,"thebearingedge":true,"mysticatea":true,"stevenvachon":true,"ta2edchimp":true,"wynpm":true},"_etag":"W/\"425695861f6314233ef62e9d7a137c75\"","_lastModified":"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 00:58:32 GMT"}
